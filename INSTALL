VBFNLO 2.7.1:  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


TO INSTALL VBFNLO:
  ./configure --[OPTIONS: see below!]
  make
  make install


TO RUN VBFNLO:
  ./bin/vbfnlo --input=PATH/TO/INPUT
  

TO RUN GGFLO (note - the input 'PROCESS' in vbfnlo.dat must be set to 4100-4107)
  ./bin/ggflo --input=PATH/TO/INPUT



VBFNLO can be configured with several options, a complete list of which can be
found by running ./configure --help.  The main options are:

 --prefix=[path] : Install VBFNLO in the location given by [path].

 --enable-processes=[list] : By default, the code for processes not involving
                              hexagons is compiled.  Optionally, [list] gives 
                              a comma-separated list of selected processes to 
                              be compiled.

 --disable-NLO : Disable the next-to-leading order QCD corrections.

 --enable-kk : Enable simulation of Kaluza-Klein resonances.  NOTE -- this
                requires the installation of the GNU scientific library, which
                needs to be specified via --with-gsl.
 
 --enable-spin2: Enable simulation of spin-2 models.   

 --with-LHAPDF=[path] : Enable the use of LHAPDF.  [path] specifies the 
                         location of LHAPDF.

 --with-gsl=[path] : Enable the use of the GNU scientific library.  [path]
                      specifies the location of GSL.

 --with-LOOPTOOLS=[path] : Enable the use of LoopTools.  [path] specifies the
                            location of LoopTools.  NOTE -- this is required
                            for calculation of the electroweak corrections.
                           
 --with-FEYNHIGGS=[path] : Enable the use of FeynHiggs.  [path] specifies the
                            location of FeynHiggs.  

 --with-ROOT=[path] : Enable the use of ROOT for histograms.  

 --with-HEPMC=[path] : Enable the production of HepMC format event files.

NOTE ALSO -- by default, LoopTools and FeynHiggs are installed as static libraries.  
              If this is the case, the additional flag --enable-shared="no" must be used.
NOTE ALSO -- to link to external programs, the same compiler must be used for VBFNLO and
              the external library.  LoopTools and FeynHiggs are by default compiled with
              g77 rather than gfortran, whereas VBFNLO is compiled with gfortran by default.
              To use g77 with VBFNLO, use: FC=F77 ./configure --[OPTIONS]
