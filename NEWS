VBFNLO 2.7.0
15 April 2014

Alterations and updates since the last release version VBFNLO 2.6.3:

  *** Major enhancements (for details see manual): ***

        * Several new processes are available: 
          Wgammajj in VBF, HHjj in VBF, W, Wj, WH, WHj, pp->Spin2jj in VBF (with 
          Spin2->WW/ZZ->leptons), several QCD induced processes (WZjj, Wgammajj, same sign 
          WWjj, Wjj)
          Anomalous gauge boson couplings are supported in VBF Wgammajj, WH, WHj.
        * Semileptonic decay modes are available in the following diboson, triboson and 
          VBF diboson plus two jets processes: VV, VVV, VVgamma, VVjj with V=W,Z.
          Additionally, the Higgs production processes pp -> H -> WW/ZZ in VBF
          with semileptonic decays are available as well.
          The processes with semileptonic decays support anomalous gauge boson couplings.
        * The VBF VVjj processes can be run taking a second Higgs resonance into account
          (simplified 2HDM).
        * Anomalous gauge boson couplings are now available in all triboson (plus jet)
          processes and all VVjj production processes via VBF.
        * A larger set of operators leading to anomalous gauge boson couplings 
          is included in VBFNLO.
        * Added ability to use anomalous HVV couplings in Higgs production via
          gluon fusion, where the Higgs decays into WW or ZZ (prodIDs 4105-7)

  ***  Further updates and new features: ***

        * It is now possible to specify a desired number of unweighted events for event
          output in vbfnlo.dat
          In case VBFNLO is not able to achieve the desired number of unweighted
          events due to single events with very large weights it's also possible to
          opt for "partially unweighted events", where most of the weights will have
          weight 1, and a few will have larger weights.
        * Added 'any leptons' switch (LEPTONS = 98/99), allowing for all possible lepton
          final state combinations of 2 or 3 generations.  See manual for details.
        * m_ll cut can be switched between cutting only opposite-sign lepton combinations
          or all combinations
        * H->bb decay mode for Higgs boson production processes:
          jet cuts are applied to final state b-quarks
        * All default values of anomalous couplings are set to zero
          to avoid confusion
        * implemented staggered pT cuts for leptons and photons

  *** Other additions and bug fixes: ***

        * Phase space improvements to increase unweighting efficiency for event output in
          several VBF, di- and triboson processes
        * Phase space optimizations for Z decays in VV and VVjj

        * Path to procinfo.dat is no longer hardcoded, now it's also searched in the input
          directory
        * Increased allowed file name length for slha file
        * Print out values of g, g' used in calculation
        * in raw histogram data output: include gnuplot command files
        * New command line option --version : provides version information of VBFNLO
        * add workaround for enormous memory consumption during compilation with gfortran 4.8

        * event output for W-W-jj in VBF: color information fixed
        * Fixed bug in WWZ virtuals implementation -- new results are about a percent lower
        * Several dynamical renormalization and factorization scale choices corrected which 
          gave wrong results for the real emission part of NLO calculations:
          min(pT_jet) (ID 2), min(ET_bosons) (ID 7)
        * fix particle-antiparticle-assignment in W+jj, Zjj
        * event output for W-W+W-: fixed momenta assignment
        * Fixed line length for ifort
        * default value for cut MDIJ_MIN is changed to 0 GeV
        * works with LHAPDF version 6
        * output of per-bin error in histograms now available in the ROOT output
          of histograms defined in histograms.F






Alterations and updates since the last beta version VBFNLO 2.7.0 BETA 4:

        * New processes: Wgammajj and HHjj in VBF; QCD induced WZjj, Wgammajj, same sign WWjj, Wjj;
          W, Wj, WH, WHj
        * Simplified 2HDM available in VBF VVjj processes
        * Semileptonic decays available for ZZW, WWW, ZZZ, WWgamma, ZZgamma, WZgamma

        * implemented staggered pT cuts for leptons and photons
        * in raw histogram data output: include gnuplot command files
        * for gfortran 4.8: add workaround for enormous memory consumption during compilation
        * new tagging jet choice for semileptonic decay processes

        * Increased allowed file name length for slha file
        * event output for W-W-jj in VBF: color information fixed
        * Fixed bug in WWZ virtuals implementation -- new results
          are about a percent lower
        * fixed running scales in subtraction of NLO calculations,
          running scales for Hjjj
        * fix particle-antiparticle-assignment in W+jj, Zjj
        * fix WZ/WWZ real emission calculation with hadronic Z decay in case
          all 4/5 final state quark flavors have been requested
        * semileptonic VV(V) production: use tilde kinematics for V decay products in jet
          algorithm
        * event output for W-W+W-: fixed momenta assignment
        * removed Herwig++ interface code introduced in VBFNLO 2.7.0 beta3. 
          This interface will be superseded by a new one using the BLHA2 in the future.
          Currently, a VBFNLO version including the interface is available on request.
