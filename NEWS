VBFNLO 3.0.0 beta 1
05 August 2015

Alterations and updates since the last release version VBFNLO 2.7.1:

  *** Major enhancements (for details see manual): ***

        * Several new processes are available:
          WWj, ZZj production including the loop-induced gluon-fusion contribution
        * Interface according to the Binoth Les Houches Accord (BLHA) added
          for all VBF processes with fully leptonic decays
        * K-matrix unitarisation procedure implemented for the two 
          dimension 8 operators O_{S,0} and O_{S,1}.


*** Changes since version 2.7.0 also included in Version 2.7.1:

        * Several new processes are available:
          QCD-ZZjj, QCD-Zgammajj, VBF-Zgammajj, Z(->l+l-)Z(->nu nubar)gamma
        * Higgs decays have been implemented for the VBF-HHjj process
        * Linking with LHAPDF v6 has been enabled
        * Fixed problem with PDF convolution in QCD-(W-/W-Z/W-gamma)jj
        * Fixed missing entry of VBF-HHjj as VBF process in cut routine
        * Fixed missing axis labels on 2D histograms
