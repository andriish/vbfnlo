  This is the release of VBFNLO 2.7.1, a parton level Monte Carlo
for processes with electroweak bosons.


Once unpacked, VBFNLO has the following subdirectories:

*  amplitudes: Routines to calculate matrix elements for the processes provided.
*  doc: The source of the manual.
*  helas: Helas subroutines used to calculate helicity amplitudes.
*  loops: One-loop tensor integrals up to five-point functions.
*  PDFsets: Built-in parton distributions (CTEQ6L1 for LO and CT10 for NLO
   calculations, as well as MRST2004qed). 
*  phasespace: Specialized phasespace generators for the processes provided.
*  regress: Folder containing example results, together with input files, 
   for all processes.
*  src: Source code of the main programs and input files. 
*  utilities: Routines for administrative tasks: cuts, scale choices and interfaces.


TO INSTALL:
  ./configure --[OPTIONS] [see manual, the file INSTALL or use ./configure --help]
  make
  make install


TO RUN VBFNLO:
   ./bin/vbfnlo --input=PATH/TO/INPUT_FILES
(If the input -- e.g. vbfnlo.dat -- files are in the current directory, the
--input can of course be omitted.)


TO RUN GGFLO:
   ./bin/ggflo --input=PATH/TO/INPUT_FILES



  VBFNLO is a fully flexible parton level Monte Carlo program for the
simulation of vector boson fusion, double and triple vector boson production in
hadronic collisions at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant. 
Electroweak corrections to Higgs production via vector boson fusion are also 
included in the SM and MSSM.  VBFNLO includes Higgs and vector boson decays
with full spin correlations and all off-shell effects.  In addition, VBFNLO 
implements CP-even and CP-odd Higgs boson production via gluon fusion, associated 
with two jets, at the leading-order one-loop level.

  A variety of effects arising from beyond the Standard Model physics are 
implemented for selected processes. Processes can be run in the MSSM, anomalous
couplings of Higgs and vector bosons can be used, a Three-Site Higgsless model 
and a Warped Higgsless extra dimension model are included.  The program offers the 
possibility of generating Les Houches Accord event files for most processes 
available at leading order.

  Complete documentation, including instructions for building, installing
and running VBFNLO, is available in the doc/Manual.pdf file.
